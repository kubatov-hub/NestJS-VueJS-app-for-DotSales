# 😊 Simple Full-Stack Application

Welcome to my humble project! This is a cheerful little full-stack application built using NestJS and VueJS. It’s a simple API with just one endpoint, and it's still a work in progress. But hey, every great project starts somewhere, right?

## 🌟 Features

- **NestJS**: Our backend framework, providing a robust and scalable server-side application.
- **VueJS**: The frontend framework, making our user interface interactive and dynamic.
- **One API Endpoint**: For now, there's just one endpoint, but it's the start of something bigger!

## 🛠️ Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kubatov-hub/NestJS-VueJS-app-for-DotSales.git
    ```



## 📚 Documentation

Since the application is still in its early stages, the documentation is a bit sparse. However, here are some useful points:

- The backend is built using NestJS, so you can check their [official documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/) for more details on how to extend and work with the backend.
- The frontend uses VueJS. For more information on how to develop with Vue, refer to their [official documentation](https://vuejs.org/).

## 🤔 What's Next?

This project is just getting started. Here are a few things I'm planning to add:

- More API endpoints to make the application more functional.
- Enhanced frontend features for a better user experience.
- Proper error handling and validation in the backend.
- Comprehensive tests to ensure reliability and stability.
